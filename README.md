# Cinematic
*By Lynelle Goh<br><br>*
**3+ distinct visual scenes (with distinct “Scene” classes) <br>**
First Scene: My logo <br>
Second Scene: Introduction to the cinematic<br>
Third Scene: Main menu <br><br>
**2+ audio assets (e.g. background music and a sound effect)<br>**
First audio: Sound effect that I created myself using iPhone's Voice Memos; tapped my nail against a glass<br>
Second audio: Background music that I recorded using the same method; recorded outside noise<br><br>
**2+ image assets (one with transparent background)<br>**
First image: Has a transparent background; lettuce was drawn by me using a free [website](https://sketchpad.app/)<br>
Second image: Main menu drawing (drawn using the same website) <br><br>
**2+ geometric shapes (rendered in-engine)<br>**
Put two triangles on the logo; made a cursor on the main menu scene using the circle function <br><br>
**1+ big fancy text (composed out of engine)<br>**
My own logo (created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) with a free template) <br><br>
**1+ multi-line text (rendered in-engine)<br>**
Main menu text lines <br><br>
**1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black)<br>**
Second scene fades out to the third scene (main menu) <br><br>
**1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in from the side)<br>**
Objects will fade in & out and zoom out
